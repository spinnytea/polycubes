	this also means that once we know the orientation, we can minimize the number of rotations we need
	i.e. if there is an axis with a unique size (e.g. [sm,md,md]),
	  then we only need to rotate along that axis (+flip)
	  then we only need 8 rotations instead of all 24

	given a particular shape with a particular size, it may be oriented [sm,md,md], [md,sm,md], [md,md,sm]
	without knowing anthing more, we would need to generate all 24 rotations
	but if we rotate it up front to a normalized orientation [sm,md,md],
	then we don't need to generate comparisons for the other ones, since they will have been normalized too
