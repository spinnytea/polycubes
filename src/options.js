	more importantly, this will help us reduce the number or rotations we need to do

	this also means that once we know the orientation, we can minimize the number of rotations we need
	i.e. if there is an axis with a unique size (e.g. [sm,md,md]),
	  then we only need to rotate along that axis (+flip)
	  then we only need 8 rotations instead of all 24

	given a particular shape with a particular size, it may be oriented [sm,md,md], [md,sm,md], [md,md,sm]
	without knowing anthing more, we would need to generate all 24 rotations
	but if we rotate it up front to a normalized orientation [sm,md,md],
	then we don't need to generate comparisons for the other ones, since they will have been normalized too

	instead of every shape in one giant list, we'll have different lists for each size

	this requires NORMALIZE_ROTATIONS to work
	i mean, we _could_ do it without normalize, but it doesn't quite make sense to support that
	 - i guess a naive way would be to group by x+y+z lengths, and have too many things in the lists; it'd be _better_
	 - or we could, well, normalize the x,y,z without rotating them, and then generate all 24 rotations, but srsly, this is awful
